# BMI Calculator 📊

This repository represents my **first Android application**, a **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator**, designed to deliver quick and reliable insights into an individual’s health status using height and weight metrics.

## 📌 What is BMI?

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely accepted health indicator that helps assess whether a person falls into a healthy weight range relative to their height.

**Metric Formula:**
**BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m))²**

## 🚀 Purpose of the App

The BMI Calculator enables users to:

* Input their **height and weight**
* Instantly calculate their **BMI value**
* Understand whether they are **underweight, normal, overweight, or obese**

This application emphasizes clarity, usability, and accuracy—establishing a strong foundation for future scalability and feature expansion.

## 🌱 Why This Project Matters

As my first project, this application marks the beginning of my Android development journey. It demonstrates:

* Practical implementation of core programming concepts
* Logical problem-solving using real-world health formulas
* A user-centric mindset focused on simplicity and impact

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Enhanced UI/UX design
* Support for imperial units
* Health tips based on BMI category
* BMI history tracking and analytics
