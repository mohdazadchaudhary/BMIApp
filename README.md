This is my first App Repo in this project we have created BMI Calculator <br>
The BMI formula divides your weight by the square of your height, with different versions for metric and imperial units: Metric: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))²

BMI help us to find out wether we are fit or not by detacting weight and height
